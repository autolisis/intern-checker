Intern-checker for Internshala
=============================

Intern-checker is a simple Python script that retrieves the dashboard page from Internshala (Assuming you've logged in using the same data directory before) and gets the application status for each internship you've applied for.

I made this because I was tired of refreshing the page to check if any updates have occured.

### Dependencies

 - Python 3.4+
 - Selenium for Python (`pip3 install selenium`)
 - Chrome web-driver

Just run it with:

    python3 intern-checker.py
